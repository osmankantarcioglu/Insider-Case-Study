# Railway Build Troubleshooting Guide

If you're encountering the error:
```
[builder 6/6] RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./cmd
process "/bin/sh -c CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./cmd" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

This indicates that the Go build process is failing. Here are steps to resolve this issue:

## Solution 1: Use the Modified Dockerfile

We've created a simplified `Dockerfile.railway` that includes:
- Better debugging during build (showing file list)
- Verbose build output
- Simpler multi-stage build process

1. Make sure your project includes:
   - `Dockerfile.railway`
   - Updated `railway.toml` pointing to this new file

## Solution 2: Check for Import Conflicts

The error may be due to import conflicts in the newly added files:

1. In `database/railway_db.go`, we've removed duplicate imports that might conflict with existing ones
2. Make sure the file only imports what it needs from the standard library

## Solution 3: Try Building Locally

To identify specific build errors:

1. Run the included debug script:
   ```
   chmod +x debug_build.sh
   ./debug_build.sh
   ```

2. This will show detailed build errors that may not be visible in Railway's logs

## Solution 4: Simplify the Code For Testing

If you still encounter build errors:

1. Temporarily simplify `database/railway_db.go` to just the bare minimum:
   ```go
   package database

   // NewRailwayDBConfig is a simplified version for testing
   func NewRailwayDBConfig() *DBConfig {
       return NewDBConfig()
   }
   ```

2. Simplify the Railway detection in `cmd/main.go`:
   ```go
   // Simplified for testing
   dbConfig := database.NewDBConfig()
   ```

3. Deploy this simpler version first, then gradually add back the full functionality

## Solution 5: Use Docker Compose with the New Dockerfile

Test your build locally before deploying:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-railway-test.yml build
```

Where `docker-compose-railway-test.yml` contains:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.railway
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - PORT=8080
```

## Solution 6: Check Railway Logs for More Details

If the build still fails:

1. Go to Railway dashboard -> Your app -> Deployments
2. Find the failed deployment
3. Click on it to see the full build logs
4. Look for specific Go compiler errors before the "exit code: 1" message

These detailed errors will point to exactly what needs to be fixed in your code.
